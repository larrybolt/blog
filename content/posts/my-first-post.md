Manditory Hello World!

There, now that is done, I can move on to more interesting things.

This blog is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a very fast static site generator written in Golang. Which makes it platform independant. This allows me to write my posts in Markdown, and Hugo will handle the rest.

Hosting is handled by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which might not be the fastest according to [some articles](https://www.savjee.be/2017/10/Static-website-hosting-who-is-fastest/) but it's free and allows me to keep html out of my repository on github. And I can just push to github and it will build and deploy it for me.

And as to the content of this blog, I don't know yet. Probably a mix of programming related topics, personal opinions and things I want to write down so I can refer to them later.
