Chrome (or another browser) is probably one of the most used programs on your computer. And web applications are becoming as feature full as regular programs.

From a security standpoint this is bad. Annoying. Since it's not easy to stop the bad guys (malicious website) without also punishing the good guys. Even if you only visit sites you trust, like facebook. Some of your close friends might unintentionally share a link or image with you on facebook. And in some cases even without opening it, it might be too late.

If you happen to be a web developer it's even worse, since in the search for a solution for problems you might be visiting very non-trusted websites.
